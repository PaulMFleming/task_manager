# Personal Task Manager

This project is a learning exercise focused on building a task management app to practice state machine patterns in Ruby.

## Overview

- Implements task lifecycle states: pending, in-progress, completed, archived.
- Utilizes the `state_machines` Ruby gem to model state transitions.
- Includes tests written in RSpec to ensure correctness.
- Designed as a progressive learning project to master complex code patterns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.7+
- Bundler gem

### Installation

```
git clone
cd task_manager
bundle install
```

### Usage

- Start by exploring the `task.rb` for the state machine implementation.
- Run tests with:

```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Contributing
